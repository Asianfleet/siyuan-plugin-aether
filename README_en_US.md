# Aether

Aether —— Where Dialogue Meets Depth.

## Introduction

Aether is a plugin designed for Siyuan notes software. The plugin adds a button to the sidebar that, when clicked, opens a side panel for dialogue with large language models (more features integrated with Siyuan will be added later).
⚠️ **Notice:** Due to personal time constraints, this is currently an **extremely early** version. There will be significant changes before the version stabilizes, please save your dialogue information elsewhere in a timely manner.

## Getting Started

## Feature Introduction

### Interface

- **Model Selection and Configuration**
    1. Click the model selection button in the lower right corner
        <p align="center">
            <img src="asset/model_select.png" alt="catenaconf logo" width=70%/>
            <p align="center">Click this button to open the dialogue interface</p>
        </p>
    2. Here you can choose the corresponding model service provider and enter the corresponding API Key, then click the save button to save the API Key to internal configuration, and subsequent dialogues will use the selected model in the panel. To switch models, you need to open the panel again, select another model, and click the save button. (Currently only supports providers such as Alibaba Cloud, DeepSeek, OpenAI, Siliconflow, and Agicto, and will support more service providers and custom providers later.)
